Known limitations:
- TSynWeb support only single line SetLine (don't use more than one line).
  This shouldn't be ANY problem, as the function name is SetLine (not SetText)

- Doesn't support #13#10, #10 or #13 as new line. Always use #0 as line break.

- Php: Doesn't support multi-line encapsuled strings in String, only single line:
  eg. "somestring {$a["some array{$b['key'].... <- only single line encapsuled values

- 'language' attrib in 'script' tag (strict version of HTML/XHTML)
  Strict version doesn't allow 'language' attrib, so code between:
  <script language="php">
  ...
  </script>
  will NOT be highlighted as PHP, but ECMAScript/JavaScript!
